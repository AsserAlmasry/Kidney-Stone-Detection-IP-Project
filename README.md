# Kidney-Stone-Detection-IP-Project
Advanced Image &amp; Video Processing Pipeline for Medical Analysis, Detecting the presence of stone in a kidney using image processing techniques

An automated kidney stone detection system using MATLAB enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces radiologist workload, and improves patient outcomes.

Its adaptability and research value contribute significantly to medical image analysis.

âž¢ Proposal:

The proposed system is designed to automatically detect kidney stones in medical ultrasound images or video frames. The system employs a structured image processing pipeline that includes the following steps: 

1. Input Handling: Support for both static images and video files, enabling real-time frame extraction and processing. 

2. Preprocessing: Conversion to grayscale, noise reduction using median filtering, and intensity-based thresholding. 

3. Edge Detection: Application of Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny edge detection methods to enhance boundaries of the stones. 

4. Morphological Operations: Filling holes, removing unwanted noise, and identifying regions of interest (ROIs). 

5. Kidney Stone Masking: Segmentation of the kidney stone area using ROI selection and masking techniques. 

6. Output Results: Displaying intermediate processing steps and indicating the presence or absence of stones. 

7. Contrast Enhancement: Applying custom enhancement techniques to improve visibility in various intensity ranges.
